        <hr>
        <p>
            Before starting with with our project, we sat down together
            and made a skecth on a whiteboard of how we wanted our website to look like.
            We got some good ideas and settled on a layout concept.We went 
            trough the lectures together and made a overview of what
            semantic tags could be of use for us and how to use these. 
            Some of these semantic tags that are included on our page is;
            Section, main, footer, aside etc.  
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class = "content">
        <h2>Why this exact content?</h2> 
        <hr>
        <p>
            We have discussed how to make our website compatible with its users, 
            and we came down to using some contents that we have researched through the web.
            The website that we have used to check our content are 
            <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">W3schools</a>.
            With this website, we have gotten answers to our discussions and to 
            better our own website.
            We have also used the previous lectures to get information on how the different 
            elements are displayed on the website.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class = "content">
        <h2>Which HTML elements were the best option?</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
          We have used semantic elements such as nav, main and footer. 
          These elements are good to use because they clearly describe
          its meaning to the browser and the developor. 
          By using such tags we create a better site structure. The list tags have
          also helped us build a compatible website for the users. 
          Since the order of the contents of the lists are not important,
          the &lt;ul&gt; tag is the best option to use. Unordered lists are also used
          to create navigation menus, which we have implemented in our navigation bar.
          To create an easy structure for our page, we have used the element
          &lt;section&gt; to divide our website to display new items of content in new sections.
